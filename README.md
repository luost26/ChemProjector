## Install

### Clone Repo

Please clone the repository with the `--recurse-submodules` flag to *include the third-party submodules*.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/luost26/ChemProjector.git
```

### Environment

```bash
# Install conda environment
conda env create -f env.yml -n chemprojector
conda activate chemprojector

# Install ChemProjector package
pip install -e .
```

The default CUDA version is 11.8. If you have to use a different version, please modify the `env.yml` file accordingly.


### Building Block Data

We provide preprocessed building block data. You can download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1scui0RZ8oeroDAafnw4jgTi3yKtXxXpe/view?usp=drive_link) and put it in the `data` directory.

However, the data is derived from Enamine's building block catalog, which are **available only upon request**.
Therefore, you should first request the data from Enamine [here](https://enamine.net/building-blocks/building-blocks-catalog) and download the <ins>US Stock</ins> catalog into the `data` directory.
Then run the following script which will check whether you have a copy of the Enamine's catalog and unarchive the preprocessed data for you:
```bash
python unarchive_wizard.py
```

You may also process the building block data by yourself. Please refer to the `scripts/preprocess_data` directory for more details.


### Trained Weights

You can download the trained weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T9f9MsEAsAjPV8GR0pXimHKCvq97SIzs?usp=drive_link) and put them in the `data/trained_weights` directory.

## Usage

### Project Molecules

You can create a list of SMILES strings in CSV format (example: `data/example.csv`) and run the following command to project them into the synthesizable chemical space.
```bash
python sample.py \
    --model-path data/trained_weights/original_default.ckpt \
    --input data/example.csv \
    --output results/example.csv
```
